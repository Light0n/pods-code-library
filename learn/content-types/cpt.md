Post Types, in WordPress, are different types of content. Don't let the name "post type" confuse you - <strong>it actually refers to any type of content</strong>. A more accurate way of describing it would be as a content type. There are five default post types that come with WordPress, all of which you'll be familiar with:
<ul>
	<li>Posts</li>
	<li>Pages</li>
	<li>Attachments</li>
	<li>Revisions</li>
	<li>Nav Menus</li>
</ul>
<h4>Custom Post Types</h4>
Custom Post Types are <strong>post types that are created in addition to those bundled with WordPress core</strong>. When you activate a theme or a plugin you may find that the developer has included custom post types. Or you may decide that the functionality you have isn't adequate to your needs, and decide that you need to create your own.
<h4>Uses for Custom Post Types</h4>
Custom Post Types are used in a wide variety of ways across the WordPress ecosystem. Any time you need a content type that is different to the default types, you'll need to start thinking about them. Some examples of how they are used are:
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-73" src="http://pods.io/files/2013/02/products1.jpg" alt="products" width="159" height="144" />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Products</strong> for an ecommerce site</li>
	<li><strong>Testimonials</strong> and a <strong>Showcase</strong> for a web portfolio</li>
	<li><strong>Listings</strong> for a real estate website</li>
	<li><strong>Reviews</strong> for a gaming website</li>
	<li><strong>Events</strong> for an event calendar</li>
	<li><strong>Vehicles</strong> for an Automotive website</li>
</ul>
You can create a post type for each of these, give them their own additional data and taxonomies, and then output them using your theme. This increases the flexibility of WordPress as you're not limited to the content types that it comes bundled with.
<h4>Creating Custom Post Types</h4>
If you code Custom Post Types yourself, you do this be registering the post type in the <code>functions.php</code> file of your theme, or in a plugin. Within this you can define the properties of the post type and how it acts within WordPress. The WordPress Codex has a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types">guide to Post Types</a> with information on coding them.

A plugin like Pods <strong>takes care of all of that coding for you</strong>. You can create the post type from your WordPress Admin, assigning all of the different properties and values that you need. This means that you don't need to be a coder to make use of WordPress's flexibility.

To make full use of Custom Post Types, you'll also need to learn about WordPress Taxonomies and Custom Fields.
