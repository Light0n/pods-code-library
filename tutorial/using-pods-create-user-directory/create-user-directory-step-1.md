To begin, after you have installed Pods, select "Add New Pod" from the "Pods Admin" menu. Because we want to work with the user profile, choose "Extend Existing" and then select “Users” from the drop-down menu on the next screen.

Pods allows us to extend the standard post types (post, pages) as well as media, users and comments with custom fields. We encourage you to play around with the different types of content types and fields to get a feel for what you may want to use. For now, extending the user profile is our goal.
