As well as creating new Custom Post Types, you can extend Post Types already available in your WordPress website. You may wish to extend the WordPress defaults, or extend a Post Type created by another plugin or theme. You can also extend Post Types that you have already created with Pods.
<h3>Select the Post Type to Extend</h3>
Navigate to <strong>Pods Admin &gt; Add New</strong> and select <strong>Extend Existing</strong>.

From the Content Type drop-down you can select from the following:
<ul>
	<li>Post Types</li>
	<li>Taxonomies</li>
	<li>Media</li>
	<li>Users</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>
You may find it useful to add extra fields to your Media, Users, and Comments, but for now select Post Types.

The Post Type drop-down lets you choose which Post Type you wish to extend.

When you're happy, <strong>Next Step</strong>.

You'll now be able to add fields, just as you did with your custom post type. <a title="How to Create a Custom Post Type" href="http://pods.io/docs/build/how-to-create-a-custom-post-type/">The guide on creating a custom post type, has information on adding fields.</a>
