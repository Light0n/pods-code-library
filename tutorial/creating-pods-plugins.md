Creating Pods plugins is a great way to either add custom functionality to your Pods-powered site or to contribute a new feature for all Pods users to take advantage of. This series covers the basics of creating Pods Plugins from our <a href="https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-extend">starter plugin</a>. As a practical example of using the starter plugin I have created a new plugin, Pods Frontier Auto Template, and a tutorial explaining how it was written.

Examples of Pods Plugins:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Pods SEO plugin page on WordPress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pods-seo/" target="_blank">Pods SEO</a></li>
	<li><a title="Pods Alternative Cache GitHub repository" href="https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-alternative-cache" target="_blank">Pods Alternative Cache</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-frontier-auto-template">Pods Frontier Auto Template</a></li>
	<li><a title="Pods CSV import WordPress.org download page" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/csv-importer-for-pods/" target="_blank">Pods CSV Import</a></li>
</ul>
