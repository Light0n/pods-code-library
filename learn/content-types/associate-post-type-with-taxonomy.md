Whenever you create a Custom Post Type, you'll need to associate it to a Taxonomy for organization. And when you create a Custom Taxonomy, you'll need to associate it with a Post Type, otherwise it will have nothing to classify. Here are some examples:
<ul>
	<li>A Books post type needs to be associated with Genre and Author taxonomies</li>
	<li>A Products post type needs to be associated with Brand and Size taxonomies</li>
	<li>A Real Estate Listings post type needs to be associated with a Region taxonomy</li>
	<li>A Vehicle post type needs to be associate with a Manufacturer taxonomy</li>
</ul>
You can also associate Custom Taxonomies with the default WordPress Post Types. You may wish to have additional taxonomies for organizing your Pages or Posts, for example.

And you can also associate Custom Post Types with the default WordPress Taxonomies, categories and tags.

Associating a Custom Post Type with a Taxonomy is done either through the Custom Post Type admin screen, or the Custom Taxonomy admin screen.
