## WordPress Content Types and Fields

WordPress is all about creating content. It comes bundled with Posts and Pages, which you can organise using the Categories and Tags taxonomies. It’s also got post meta fields which you can use to append data to your content – author, date, and custom fields, for example.

But what if you want more than the WordPress defaults? After all, you may require more types of content than simply Posts and Pages. Categories and Tags might not cover all the ways in which you wish to classify your content. You may wish to append your content with more metadata than WordPress provides for.

## How Pods Helps You

With WordPress, it’s possible to create Custom Content Types and Custom Fields. Usually this involves writing the PHP that you need. With Pods, you can create all of the Custom Content Types and Custom Fields that you need from within the WordPress Admin Screens. A WordPress website with Pods enabled is much more powerful and flexible than a WordPress website on its own.

You can also use Pods to extend your current content types. Perhaps you want to add some taxonomies to your Pages – WordPress doesn’t have any taxonomies active for Pages by default. Or you could add more Custom Fields to your Posts and output that data with your theme.

## How it works

Pods has an intuitive admin interface. You can choose whether you wish to create a new content type or extend an existing content type:
